# Connect Four 
This is a simple game for the Casio fx-9860GII calculator. It might also work on other calculators, but during development, i found out that it's quite a struggle to find the differences between those models. I included the compiled version, which is a .g1a file and the source file, which is written in C. 
# How to use it 
To transfer a program to your Calculator, your need a Program Link Software, which can be found here: https://edu.casio.com/forteachers/er/software/. 
If you want to edit the file an compile it yourself, you need the Casio SDK, which can be found here: https://edu.casio.com/download_service/de/download/index.html.
